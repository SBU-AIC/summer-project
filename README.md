# AIC Summer 2023 project

The purpose of this project is to fill the gap in the middle of the summer.

Students will also be encouraged to apply their previous knowledge.

## Project description

There is a correlation between two currencies in the dataset.

This project aims to implement a genetic algorithm that can determine the relationship between the two currencies.

Furthermore, the relation can be used to predict the value of one currency based on the value of another. 

A linear regression model is already provided to plot their relation so the results can be compared.
1. Complete the genetic algorithm implementation
2. Compare the results with the result of the linear regression model
3. Try to modify your model parameters and functions to get better results.
